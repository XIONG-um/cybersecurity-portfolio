# Cybersecurity Portfolio - XIONG JIAYI

## 1. About Me
My name's XIONG JIAYI, a dedicated student currently pursuing a Master's level course in Cybey security. My interest in cybersecurity stems from a fascination with how digital systems are defended against evolving threats. 
I'm committed to developing a strong foundation in network security, risk management, and ethical hacking. This portfolio tracks my learning journey, showcasing the projects and skills I acquire as I transition into a cybersecurity professional.

## 2. Technical Skills
### **Networking & Security Fundamentals**
* **Protocols**: Basic understanding of TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP/HTTPS, and SSH.
* **Models**: Familiarity with the OSI 7-Layer model and its security implications at each layer.
* **Concepts**: Knowledge of CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) and basic encryption principles.
### **Tools & Environments**
* **Operating Systems**: Basic navigation and command-line usage in Linux (Ubuntu/Kali) and Windows.
* **Security Tools**: Initial experience with Nmap for network discovery and Wireshark for packet sniffing.
### **Soft Skills**
* Analytical thinking and problem-solving.
* Continuous learner with a strong ethical mindset.
  
## 3. Certifications and Training
* **Academic Training**:
* Currently enrolled in University of Malaysia, studying in Cyber security courses,focusing on the core principles of information security and risk management.
*  **Online Security Labs**:
*   Actively practicing on platforms like TryHackMe and Hack The Box to develop hands-on penetration testing skills (e.g., Linux fundamentals, network exploitation).
* **Self-Paced Learning**:
* I attended courses at a domestic training institution, where I mainly learned technologies such as Linux, SQL, and Python, as well as related cybersecurity regulations.
* I have not yet had any formal involvement in practical projects.
* Currently not taking any professional certification exams（e.g, CompTIA Security+、CEH、CISSP）.
## 4. Project Experience
### Project 1: Basic Network Vulnerability Scanning
* **Objective**: To identify active devices and open ports within a local network environment.
* **Tools**: Nmap. 
* **Methodology**: Performed a TCP connect scan to discover services running on target hosts.
* **Outcome**: Successfully identified potentially vulnerable open ports and proposed basic firewall rules to close them. 
### Project 2: Autonomous threat hunter
* **Objective**:it includes network scanning, traffic generation, machine learning, and real-time monitoring
* * **Tools**: Shodan、Jupyter、Python.
* * **Methodology**:
  * Develop a self-learning security agent for remote IoT networks.
  * The main activities include:
    * Mapping the environment.
    * Generating your own training data using Python scripts。
    * Using machine learning to classify traffic based on statistical behaviors (packet size, timing).
    * Implement visualized threats
* **Outcome**:
  * Successfully completed reconnaissance of the target and constructed the relevant dataset.
  * Using the trained dataset, a confusion matrix was created through the random forest model.
  * An embedded dashboard was created using HTML technology, enabling real-time monitoring.
## 5. Learning Journey
* * **Summary**:
  * Through studying the current courses, I have initially entered the field of cybersecurity.
  * I have mastered basic network reconnaissance techniques and learned how to use Wireshark to interpret data packets.
* * **Challenge**:
  * I find complex command-line scripting and understanding deep cryptographic protocols challenging.
  * To overcome this, I am dedicating extra time to Python for Cybersecurity and practicing daily on platforms like TryHackMe to build muscle memory for Linux commands.
 ## 6. Career Objective
 My goal is to become a Professional Penetration Tester. 
 I am driven by the desire to help organizations proactively secure their infrastructure by identifying vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them
* * **Short-Term Goal**:To master the OWASP Top 10 web vulnerabilities and gain proficiency in automated and manual scanning tools.
* * **Long-Term Goal**:I aim to obtain industry-recognized certifications such as OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional) and contribute to the cybersecurity community through responsible vulnerability disclosure and security research.
